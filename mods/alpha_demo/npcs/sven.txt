him=Howdy, stranger. This here is Trappers Corner, we trade in all matter of things here. A lot of folk pass through here and sell elaborate wares from across the globe.
you=Spectacular. You must be the leader?
him=More precisely a member. Our members hold together a truce of justice for foul play. Without justice there is crime, and crime brews unstability.
you=Any local guides that may be of help?
him=Indeed, theres a woodsman around here that claims to know the routes around here like the back of his hand.

you=So how's the mining business?
him=Not good at all. While I was digging, my pickaxe scraped a skull that was wedged in the rock wall. Before I knew it, the nasty thing started moving and a whole body emerged. Now that thing is in there, preventing any more mining.
him=Kill that troll for me, and I'll make it worth your while.
