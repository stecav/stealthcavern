you=Are you the local woodsman?
him=Indeed I am. And your with the party from Cambria.
him=Well met neighbour. I heared about the troubles in Cambria. What news from there?
you=Its not looking good im afraid. Theres word of a larger force on its way.
him=In that case we are all in danger. If I could be of any assistance...
you=Actually we are looking for some good men to join us in combat.
him=My bow has not seen that kind of combat. I'm afraid I would be of no use to you. I'm a hunter not a fighter.
you=I understand.
him=Hmm, I wonder...
him=Perhaps I can be of some help. During my years I have gained an affinity with the local wildlife.
him=I have come to think of some as comrades. If treated right, they can be the most loyal of companions.
you=Thanks all the same but im not sure how much help a few woodland critters would be.
him=Dont underestimate the power of nature. Some of these creatures are fierce.
him=Humor me if you will. Lets see if you've got what it takes.
him=In the tundra to the north lives a troll. He's a little flighty but can be friendly if he trusts you.
him=Here take this fruit. If you can get close to him, give him one of these.

him=Getting close to him might not be so easy. Take a few of these traps aswell. They wont hurt him but will give you a chance to get close.

him=Come back and see me when you manage to gain his trust.
him=And please, do not kill him. Use only fruit and traps.

you=Not so good. I used all of the traps already.
him=Ok heres a couple more. Try to anticipate where he is moving to and place the trap in his path.

him=Have you tamed the beast yet?
you=No not yet. I dont have any apples left.
him=Make sure your close enough to give them to him. If you cant catch him, try to use those traps I gave you to slow him down. Heres a couple more fruit.
him=And please, do not kill him. Use only fruit and traps.

you=Are you impressed?
him=Congratulations. See if you can do it a bit faster next time.
you=Are you kidding?
him=Hah I knew you had it in you.
him=Keep improving and it will become more natural to you. I heared that the best tamers can apply their skill to undead or even people. I dont know if thats true or not.
you=Okay it has some promise.
him=Of course. Whats your next move?
you=I dont know. I guess its time to head out.
him=Ok good luck out there. If you happen by Vlad on your way north, say hi from me.
