him=Not good at all. While I was digging, my pickaxe scraped a skull that was wedged in the rock wall. Before I knew it, the nasty thing started moving and a whole body emerged. Now that thing is in there, preventing any more mining.
him=Kill that skeleton for me, and I'll make it worth your while.
