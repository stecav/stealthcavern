him=You look like you're just starting out.
you=Thats right. I'm still trying to remember everything.
him=You mean you don't recall anything that happened prior to arriving here?
you=Not much.
him=Well, I'm a collector. I collect items that are junk and turn them into valueble scrap. Theres a scrapper in town that trades in scrap items. I can tell you how to get started.
you=Interesting. I'd like to try that out.
him=OK, the first thing you need is a tool to break down items. It just so happens that the alchemist in town sells a mortar. That will suffice for now at least.
you=Alright, so I got to get a mortar from the alchemist. I got it.
him=The next thing you're going to need is items, and a lot of them. It doesn't matter what items either, virtually any item can be salvaged. You can find items around the world, or by defeating enemies. 
you=That sounds like the harder part.
him=I've been doing this for years, and its very lucrative.
