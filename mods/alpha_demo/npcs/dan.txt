him=Come to fight my prized creation have you? You look ill prepared to even consider such a task.
you=Perhaps so. I'm interested in learning techniques though.

you=No kidding...
him=This  will last for a thousand years and beyond, it's built so tough.
you=Well, you've made me curious now. I'd like to dish out some blows if you'd stop talking already!
him=Hahaha....be my guest. Punch, kick, swing or cast until your hearts desire!
