you=What are they screaming of?
him=They are screaming of anger and betrayal far to the east. 
you=You think there needs to be some revenge acted upon?
him=Most certainly. Far east from here is an old grave site that once held riches of old times. My son got wind of this and soon ventured out, ofcourse to his demise.
